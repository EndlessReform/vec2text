    "## Cleaning the non-prototypical arguments dataset from Papadimitriou et al. 2022\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll be cleaning and preparing the swapped arguments dataset from [Papadimitriou et al. 2022](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.06204). This dataset contains both natural and systematically swapped English sentences, designed to probe the representation of grammatical roles in language models when lexical expectations alone are insufficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "By isolating the effect of word order on contextualization, this dataset highlights how models leverage context in critical instances where compositional meaning diverges from lexical expectations. We'll be repurposing this dataset as a benchmark for embedding reconstruction models (incl. `vec2text`), to evaluate their ability to recover non-prototypical sentences."
